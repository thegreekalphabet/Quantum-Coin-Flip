Introduction
The Quantum Coin Flipper is a fun and educational project that demonstrates the power of quantum computing. By using a quantum circuit to simulate a coin flip, this project showcases how quantum mechanics can be applied to solve real-world problems in a unique way.

Features
Quantum Randomness: Utilizes quantum principles to generate truly random results.

Simple Interface: Easy-to-use command-line or web-based interface.

Educational: Learn about quantum computing and quantum circuits.

Cross-Platform: Works on any system with Python and Qiskit installed.

How It Works
The Quantum Coin Flipper uses a quantum circuit with a single qubit. The qubit is put into a superposition state using a Hadamard gate, and then measured. The measurement result (0 or 1) corresponds to "Heads" or "Tails."
